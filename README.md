Automate DNA barcode assembly, quality control, and query

# Description

DNABarcodeReader is designed to automate the steps between obtaining raw DNA sequence data and running phylogenetic/population genetic analyses. The steps include: (1) Creating individual assemblies for each sample in a dataset; (2) Generating quality control reports; (3) Querying local and WWW BLAST databases in order to assign a genus and species name to the sample based on the DNA barcode; and (4) Outputting DNA barcode sequence data into a text file in different formats for downstream analyses (e.g., FASTA).
